Eliminate the AI's Extrasensory Perception in SPT-AKI Escape from Tarkov Singleplayer
<pre>
The AIPatcher.cs file has a longer description of changes in comments.
TL;DR: 
I have used Harmony via AKI.Reflection to skip processing the IsEnemyLookingAtMe() function of Bots that causes them to go on the attack as soon as you put your
crosshair over them, even if they have their back turned to you. There are config options (requiring a game re-start for changes to take effect) allowing you to turn
this override on for the player and/or other bots. 

If you wish to donate to my paypal the link is below, I don't expect anything and have made this mod purely for fun. 
I enjoyed sneaking around and stealthily sniping AI so much I knew the community had to have it too! 
I'll keep it updated as long as I keep playing SPT-AKI.
